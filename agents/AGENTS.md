You have additional SKILLs documented in directories containing a "SKILL.md" file.

These skills are:
 - dit -> "skills/dit/SKILL.md"
 - funurl -> "skills/funurl/SKILL.md"
 - gakido -> "skills/gakido/SKILL.md"
 - sindoq -> "skills/sindoq/SKILL.md"
 - vt -> "skills/vt/SKILL.md"

IMPORTANT: You MUST read the SKILL.md file whenever the description of the skills matches the user intent, or may help accomplish their task.

dit: `Classify HTML pages, forms, and fields using machine learning. Use when the user needs to detect page types (login, error, captcha), identify form types (login, search, registration), or classify form fields (username, password, email) from HTML content or URLs.`
funurl: `Parse, modify, encode, decode, and deduplicate URLs from the command line. Use when the user needs to extract URL components, manipulate URLs, encode/decode URL strings, or deduplicate URL lists for security testing or web automation.`
gakido: `High-performance Python HTTP client with browser impersonation and anti-bot evasion. Use when the user needs to bypass bot detection, impersonate browsers with TLS fingerprinting, make HTTP/2/3 requests, or build web scrapers that evade anti-bot systems.`
sindoq: `Execute code in sandboxed environments using Docker, Podman, Wasmer, gVisor, Firecracker, Kubernetes, or cloud providers. Use when the user needs to safely run untrusted code, build AI code execution pipelines, or set up isolated sandbox environments.`
vt: `Spin up intentionally vulnerable environments from the terminal using Docker. Use when the user wants to practice security testing, set up CTF labs, exploit CVEs, or deploy vulnerable web apps like DVWA, Juice Shop, or WebGoat.`

Paths referenced within SKILL folders are relative to that SKILL. For example the example-skill `scripts/example.py` would be referenced as `example-skill/scripts/example.py`.
